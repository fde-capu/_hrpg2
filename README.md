Yet another RPG proof of concept.

This time I wanted to make a scheme for battles. Each player take turns.

On `vars.js`, the developers sets the gauges and actions, and its effects.

##### Side notes:

USe a small screen and do not complain about the layout.

This was made for fun and I will not refuse to profit from it if you find appropriate. Just do not use any of the code concepts without contracting me.
